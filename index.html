                        <h3>Te Papa Navigate uses modern technology to give the concept of a guided audio tour a new lease on life. </h3> The user will download the application when arriving at the museum, and then based on the location of the device, the application will give an audio description of what the user is looking at. The application will also have a written page with a description of the exhibit, external links etc, and this will also be loaded based on the location of the user. To be slightly more specific, the audio aspect of the tour will only be able to be used when the user has a set of headphones on, as to not disrupt the other patrons. The audio track for a specific interest point will only be triggered if the user presses a button to start listening, or alternately if the user has been looking at the interest point for 5 (arbitrary) seconds. The written pages will roll over instantly as soon as the user is in range of a different exhibit. The aesthetic for each of these group pages can change according to which exhibit the user is in, and the user can switch to manual or automatic direction of the written content so if they want to go back to another exhibit’s text content they are able to.

                    <h3>The audience for this application includes almost any member of Te Papa’s audience.</h3>
                    <br />
                    <b>Firstly we consider adults without special requirements:</b> This application would naturally enrich the museum experience by adding a certain personalised aspect to it. The application can be used like an audio tour (generally one customer by them self), or just as a general information source that is smart about what you are looking at (more suitable for a group, still works for single user).
                    <br />
                    <b>Students:</b> Students tend to travel in groups so the audio aspect of the tour may not be as useful (as there is a certain social aspect of these sorts of trips), but the written content can easily add a much richer experience, and perhaps the capability to bookmark certain exhibits and return to them at a later time could aid in study.
                    <br />
                    <b>Tourists:</b> the technology can easily be adapted to different languages by simply adding more content (translations to written and audio content). Giving those with no english skills this application can make the entire experience a lot easier and more accessible
                    <br />
                    <b>Older adults:</b> Even if they do not have a smartphone, tablet and headphone hire could work well for these users. The interface for this application should be usable and intuitive for all users, and perhaps an interface change specific for these users could be useful
                    <br />
                    <b>Disability friendly:</b> Deaf customers may be able to use the written interface to enrich their experience. Blind customers could use the audio aspect to assist. It would not be difficult to enable some simple voice commands to assist with this - locating certain exhibits, finding bathrooms etc. A wheelchair friendly mode can assist with locating the most effect path for a user to find the most efficient wheelchair friendly routes through the museum. There is no reason not to add a disability friendly mode that can be personalised to a specific person’s needs and experience. Even an assistance beacon could be added for more at risk users.

                <hr>
                <h3>The tech behind this project will be a little involved initially, but nothing that hasn’t been done before:</h3>Using WiFi routers in strategic positions throughout the museum, the user’s location can be accurately triangulated, and therefore we are able to tell the user’s exact location. Alternately, there are existing systems that can be purchased and used if a do it yourself approach doesn’t work for this. There will also be a central database storing the audio information and text based information for the Museum that the application accesses. This will require the user to be connected to the Te Papa WiFi, or at least have an internet connection for the duration of their stay at Te Papa. Alternately an offline mode could be implemented, but the drawback of this could be the size of the application depending on how the information is stored and translated.
